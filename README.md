# Switchyard Sequencer

Switchyard Sequencer is a runnable Python backend baseline for rail yard
operations. It accepts inbound train manifests, classifies cars onto standing
tracks under destination and hazard rules, plans an outbound pull sequence that
respects LIFO stacks, executes buffer moves, and closes shifts with a
deterministic yard balance. It uses only the Python standard library and local
JSON files, so it runs without an external database or online service.

## Run the service

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m switchyard.entry.server --port 8701 --data-dir data/dev
```

Or use the environment variables `SWITCHYARD_PORT` and `SWITCHYARD_DATA_DIR`.
The server exposes JSON endpoints under `/api`; `GET /api/health` returns a
simple liveness payload.

## Workflow checks

Deferred test mode is active in this baseline: no unit tests are shipped, and a
later engineering task stage adds red/green verification tests. Production
workflow checks exercise the real HTTP API:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 checks/wf_intake_classify.py
PYTHONPATH=src python3 checks/wf_outbound_sequence.py
PYTHONPATH=src python3 checks/wf_pull_depart.py
PYTHONPATH=src python3 checks/wf_close_shift.py
PYTHONPATH=src python3 checks/wf_transfer_selection.py
```

Each check starts an isolated server on a free port with a temporary data
directory and stops the server before exiting.

## Directory structure

```text
src/switchyard/domain/    entities, validation, transitions, allocation, sequencing
src/switchyard/storage/   workspace state, atomic JSON persistence, seed data
src/switchyard/service/   workflow commands and application context
src/switchyard/report/    metrics and closure summaries
src/switchyard/entry/     HTTP server, router, and request handling
checks/                   production workflow checks
data/                     runtime JSON data (created on first run)
```

The repository stores one versioned workspace file plus an append-only event
journal. Every write goes through a same-directory temporary file and an atomic
replace, so interrupted writes do not leave partial state.

## Environment variables

- `SWITCHYARD_PORT`: default service port, used when `--port` is absent.
- `SWITCHYARD_DATA_DIR`: default data directory, used when `--data-dir` is
  absent.
- `SWITCHYARD_TRANSFER_BAYS`: extra transfer lines for a fresh data directory,
  as comma-separated `CODE:CAPACITY` entries (for example
  `X1:10,X2:6`). A fresh yard seeds a single `X1` line when unset.

## Transfer line selection

`POST /api/outbound-trains/{code}/sequencer` accepts an optional
`transfer_code`. When it is omitted or blank, the sequencer binds the plan to
the transfer line with the most currently available slots (line code breaks
ties), so future lines are picked up automatically. An explicit code is still
validated strictly: an unknown line or insufficient remaining capacity rejects
the request and leaves the outbound train in `DRAFT` for a corrected retry.
Capacity already committed to queued and running plans is reserved by peak
buffer usage, so an automatic choice never silently moves or shrinks an
existing plan's occupancy. The response includes a `transfer_selection` block,
and the persisted pull run records the selected line, mode, required slots, and
capacity snapshot, keeping the choice traceable through execution, retry, and
restart.

## Example API sequence

```text
POST /api/shifts
POST /api/intake-trains
POST /api/intake-trains/INT-01/classify
POST /api/outbound-trains
POST /api/outbound-trains/OB-01/sequencer
POST /api/pull-runs/RUN-01/advance
POST /api/outbound-trains/OB-01/depart
POST /api/shifts/SHIFT-01/close
GET  /api/yard
```

Request and response examples are embedded in the project specification and in
the workflow checks.
